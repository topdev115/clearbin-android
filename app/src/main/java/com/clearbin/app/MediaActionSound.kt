/**
 * Modified by Best Solution on March 16 2021: converted original class to Kotlin,
 * fixed a minor bug and added support for respecting stream volume or setting an arbitrary
 * volume. New methods added: [playWithStreamVolume], volume parameters added to [play].
 *
 * A class for producing sounds that match those produced by various actions
 * taken by the media and camera APIs.
 *
 * This class is recommended for use with the [android.hardware.camera2] API, since the
 * camera2 API does not play any sounds on its own for any capture or video recording actions.
 *
 * With the older [android.hardware.Camera] API, use this class to play an appropriate
 * camera operation sound when implementing a custom still or video recording mechanism (through the
 * Camera preview callbacks with
 * [Camera.setPreviewCallback][android.hardware.Camera.setPreviewCallback], or through GPU
 * processing with [Camera.setPreviewTexture][android.hardware.Camera.setPreviewTexture], for
 * example), or when implementing some other camera-like function in your application.
 *
 * There is no need to play sounds when using
 * [Camera.takePicture][android.hardware.Camera.takePicture] or
 * [android.media.MediaRecorder] for still images or video, respectively,
 * as the Android framework will play the appropriate sounds when needed for
 * these calls.
